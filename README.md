DMA-Controlled PWM for WS2812B LEDs with TIM1
This project demonstrates how to generate PWM signals for controlling WS2812B LEDs using the STM32's TIM1 timer and DMA (Direct Memory Access). The code initializes and configures the TIM1 peripheral to drive the LEDs and uses DMA to efficiently transfer RGB data to the timer's output compare register. The system allows for precise control of the LEDs using DMA without occupying the main CPU for data transfer.

Features
DMA-Controlled PWM Signals: Uses DMA to transfer RGB data to the TIM1 peripheral, allowing efficient and precise control of the WS2812B LEDs.
Interrupt-Driven System: Configures and handles DMA transfer completion through interrupts, ensuring non-blocking operation.
Custom RGB LED Control: Functions to set individual LEDs to specific RGB values or sequentially turn them on with customizable delays.

Components
STM32 Microcontroller: The project is designed for STM32 microcontrollers using the TIM1 peripheral to generate PWM signals.
WS2812B LEDs: These addressable RGB LEDs are controlled via the PWM signals generated by the TIM1 peripheral.
DMA (Direct Memory Access): DMA is used to transfer data to the TIM1 peripheral for efficient control of the LEDs.

Functions
TIM1_Init(): Initializes TIM1 with a given period for generating PWM signals.
TIM1_OC_Init(): Configures TIM1 Channel 3 for PWM output.
TIM1_DMA_Init(): Initializes DMA to transfer RGB data to the TIM1 peripheral.
Enable_DMA_PWM(): Enables DMA and TIM1 for PWM signal generation.
Disable_DMA_PWM(): Disables DMA and TIM1 when not in use.
NVIC_Config(): Configures interrupts for DMA transfer completion.
DMA2_Stream6_IRQHandler(): Handles DMA transfer completion interrupt.

How It Works
Timer Configuration: TIM1 is initialized and configured in PWM mode to drive the WS2812B LEDs.
DMA Setup: DMA is set up to transfer the RGB data from memory to the TIM1 capture/compare register (CCR3) in a continuous manner.
PWM Signal Generation: Using DMA, the RGB values are sent to the LEDs without the need for CPU intervention, allowing precise timing and control of the PWM signals.
Interrupt Handling: Once a DMA transfer is complete, an interrupt is triggered, and the DMA and TIM1 are disabled to prevent unnecessary data transmission.

How to Use
Clone the repository and open the project in your STM32 development environment (e.g., STM32CubeIDE or IAR).
Configure your hardware setup, including connecting the WS2812B LEDs to the appropriate GPIO pins (PA10 for TIM1_CH3 and PB15 for TIM1_CH3N).
Build and flash the project to your STM32 microcontroller.
Modify the sequentialLedOn() function to change the colors, delays, and patterns of the LEDs.

Prerequisites
STM32 Development Board (e.g., STM32F4 series or similar with TIM1 support)
WS2812B Addressable LEDs
STM32CubeIDE or IAR Embedded Workbench for compiling and flashing the project
Basic understanding of PWM, DMA, and interrupt handling

Hardware Connections
PA10 (TIM1_CH3) should be connected to the data input of the WS2812B LED strip.
PB15 (TIM1_CH3N) can be used for complementary PWM signals if required.

Important Notes
Power Supply: The current provided by the Blackpill microcontroller is not sufficient to power the WS2812B LEDs properly. It is recommended to use an external 5V DC power supply to ensure stable operation. Make sure to connect the external power supply's ground to the MCU's ground to avoid any ground loop issues.

Signal Degradation: As the number of LEDs increases, signal degradation may occur in the PWM signal due to longer distances and higher load. To prevent this, a 5V PWM signal is used to ensure stable and reliable communication with all LEDs. For this purpose, a 74HCT245 logic level converter is used to convert the STM32's 3.3V PWM signal to 5V, which is necessary for proper control of the WS2812B LEDs.

The project has been developed using the C programming language and was compiled using IAR Embedded Workbench, version 7.80. It is designed to run on an STM32 microcontroller, but can be adapted to other platforms with minor modifications.

Please note that only the core project files (ws2812b.c, ws2812b.h, timer.c, timer.h and main.c) have been provided. You will need to implement other necessary configurations, such as IO initialization and RCC enabling, according to your own compiler and library setup. Ensure that the hardware-specific settings are adjusted for your environment.

The project also includes the design of the electronic circuit schematic, outlining the components and their connections. However, it does not include a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design.
